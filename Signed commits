Signed commits 

Tips:

To configure your Git client to sign commits by default for a local repository, in Git versions 2.0.0 and above, (run git config commit.gpgsign true) 
To sign all commits by default in any local repository on your computer, run (git config --global commit.gpgsign true)



When committing changes in your local branch, add the -S flag to the git commit command:

$ git commit -S -m your commit message
# Creates a signed commit
